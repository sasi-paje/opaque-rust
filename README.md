# opaque-rust
Implementation of the Opaque protocol in Rust with integration support for wasm, ffi and others. This implementation is directly related to the [draft-irtf-cfrg-opaque](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-opaque) and is based on [draft-irtf-cfrg-opaque poc](https://github.com/cfrg/draft-irtf-cfrg-opaque).
